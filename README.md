# Booth's Algorithm in Java

## Introduction
Booth's Algorithm is an efficient method for performing signed binary multiplication using two's complement notation. It reduces the number of required arithmetic operations by encoding multiplication as a series of shifts and additions/subtractions.

## Features
- Implements Booth's Algorithm for signed multiplication
- Handles both positive and negative numbers
- Optimized for two's complement multiplication

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java IDE or command-line terminal

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile and run the Java program.
3. Enter the multiplicand and multiplier when prompted.

## Example
Given two numbers as input, the program calculates their product using Booth's Algorithm and displays the result in both binary and decimal formats.
